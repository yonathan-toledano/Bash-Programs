# Bash-Programs
Network Research
This repository contain all scripts made to help my classmates during are Network Research model in the jbt institute.
Some of the scripts in Bash-Programs are just displaying answers to jbt-labs using a simple echo command to print the answer,
Those labs were given in class using a modified virtual machine 
Other scripts may require superuser permission to provide the answer.
If needed some functions will automatically download files or install apts from the wed.
Etention some qestions require port configuration, some command go directly to the etc directory and reconfigurs files. 
Please make sure you fully understand the question before using one of the scripts options.
