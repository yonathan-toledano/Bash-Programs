# Bash-Programs
Network Research,
This repository contains all scripts made to help my classmates during our Network Research module in the JBT institute.
Some of the scripts in Bash-scripts are just displaying answers to JBT assignments using a simple echo command to print the answer,
Those assignments were given in class using a modified virtual machine. 
Other scripts may require superuser permissions to provide the answer.
If needed some functions will automatically download files or install apts from the wed.
Etention some qestions require port configuration, some command go directly to the etc directory and reconfigurs files. 
Please make sure you fully understand the question before using one of the scripts options.

The scripts were written using nano on Ubuntu 18.04.6
